-contrastive loss
-try pretraining input and output the same
-try pretraining like masking parts of the input and autocompletion
-check the uncertainties for both pretraining techniques



0-better to know the ways of calculating uncertainty to use it after each finetune
1-using current status using Sarah's contribution then funetune
2-using 1 with the weights from the transUnet
3-using the contrastive loss on Patches (also with and without transUnet weights)
4-at the location of the removed indices add noise in the projection instead of only zeros
